Making life simple for organizing a Merit Badge University

When complete, this application will facilitate all aspects of organizing a Merit Badge University (typically a day-long session at a single location where scouts can complete courses taught by merit badge counselors and venturer instructors.)  It helps with early planning activities like setting up classroom resources registering courses.  On the day of MBU, the app helps to make sign-in a snap.  Useful information like course schedules and prerequisites are easy to get and print out.  Afterward, instructors can use the app to quickly track students progress and print reports or event the merit badge cards themselves!
